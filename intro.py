He claims he would never do anything to hurt his brother, but also admits he is still angry that Jason's Eagles beat Travis' Chiefs earlier this past season.\n")
        print("Tom Brady: One of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. TB12, as he is known, won multiple Super Bowls with the New England Patriots. One of the few blemishes on his otherwise perfect resume is a loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl 52.\n")
        print("Jalen Hurts: The MVP caliber quarterback who has led the Eagles the past few seasons. However, in all his years playing with Kelce he has yet to be able to win a Super Bowl.\n")
        print("Brock Purdy: The young star quarterback of the San Fransisco 49ers. He has had a very successful start to his career but he is still hunting for his first Super Bowl. He came close in 2023 but was defeated by the Eagles in the NFC Championship game.\n")
        print("Spencer Strider: An all-star pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of the MLB. He has been dominant his whole career, but has yet to be able to beat the Phillies in the MLB playoffs. He hates all things Philly and no one is more Philly than Jason Kelce.\n")
        print("We have found several clues at various landmarks around the city. Specifically at The Liberty Bell, Boat House Row, Independence Hall, Citizens Bank Park, and The Ben Franklin Bridge.\n")
        print("Your task will be to explore these landmarks and gather clues that will help you catch the killer.")
        print("Once you think you have found the killer, travel to the crime scene and make your guess. But be warned you only have one chance to guess the killer. If you guess wrong the killer walks free.\n")
        print("Good Luck!!\n")
